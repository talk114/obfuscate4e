==Installation of the obfuscate4e feature==

To install this feature you simply have to use the update site facilities built into the Eclipse IDE.

# Inside Eclipse go to _Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Find and Install ..._ and define a remote site pointing to <a href="http://obfuscate4e.org/updates/">http://obfuscate4e.org/updates/</a><br><img alt="Add obfuscate4e update site" src="images/update_site_preview.png" height="400" width="393">
# Select the _obfuscate4e_ feature from the list of installable features<br><img alt="Select the features" src="images/update_feature_preview.png" height="333" width="400">
# Accept the <a href="http://obfuscate4e.org/license">license</a> and define the installation location.<br><img alt="Install the o4e feature" src="images/install_feature_preview.png" height="333" width="400">
# Press <strong>Finish</strong> to install the software on your hard disk,

That's it! Now you can use obfuscation in your projects.

==Configure the obfuscation==

Now it's time to configure how _obfuscate4e_ and its embedded obfuscator should work. We use the ProGuard obfuscator in this sectin. The configuration of other obfuscators will differ.

Execute the action _Create Proguard obfuscation configuration_ from the context menu of the plugin _MANIFEST.MF_.

<img src="images/generate_custombuildcallbacks.png" alt="Generate custombuildcallbacks.xml" height="490" width="500">

In the project folder appear two new files: _customBuildCallbacks.xml_ and _proguard.cfg_. These files are managed inside your project (and also version controlled).

<img src="images/new_custombuildcallbacks.png" alt="New build script" height="130" width="285">

ProGuard allows to highly customize the obfuscation process. You can add cunfiguration statements to the _proguard.cfg_ file. See <a href="http://proguard.sourceforge.net/manual/usage.html">http://proguard.sourceforge.net/manual/usage.html</a> for valid configuration parameters.

===Excluding classes or packages from obfuscation===

Obfuscate4e detects exported packages and and writes the corresponding obfuscation exclusion statements automatically into the file _proguard.cfg_ at your plugin's root directory.

Starting from version 0.7 of _obfuscate4e_ all classes references from plugin extensions (in _plugin.xml_) are automatically inserted into the obfuscator exclusion list. Thus the obfuscate4e configuration should be updated whenever a new extension is added to the plugin.<br>
_Remark: This feature works only on Eclipse 3.4 (there seems to be a bug or non-implemented feature in Eclipse 3.2 and 3.3)_

Of course you can add custom exclusion statements by hand. For instance If a class gets instantiated via reflection or is referenced by name in any other way, it has to be excluded.

====Exclude all classes in a package====

By default _obfuscate4e_ adds all exported packages of a plugin to the exclusion list.

There are to options if you want to add other packages to the exclution list:<!--break-->

# Export the package using the Manifest editor (if this is useful for your project)
# Add a following lines to the plugin's _proguard.cfg_ file:<br>

  {{{
  -keep class de.example.plugin.* {
    public protected *; 
  }
  }}}

  _Remark: If you modified the proguard.cfg file manually, then these changes will be lost when re-generating the configuration!_

====Exclude a single class====

You might want to exclude a certain file from obfuscation. This might be the case if the class is used in an extension of your plugin.<!--break-->

To exclude a class from obfuscation you have to add a statement like

{{{
-keep class de.example.plugin.actions.MySpecialAction {
  public protected *;
}
}}}

to the _proguard.cfg_ file. All other classes in the package _de.example.plugin.actions_ are completely obfuscated.

_Remark: If you modified the proguard.cfg file manually, then these changes will be lost when re-generating the configuration!_

====Exclude all classes of a certain kind====

To exclude all classes that implement a certain interface or extend a certain class (e.g. all views, actions, perspectives, wizards, ...) in a generic way you need to exclude the appropriate interfaces or super classes:

{{{
-keep class * extends org.eclipse.ui.part.ViewPart {
  public *;
}
-keep class * implements org.eclipse.jface.action.IAction {
  public *;
}
-keep class * implements org.eclipse.ui.IPerspectiveFactory {
  public *;
}
-keep class * implements org.eclipse.equinox.app.IApplication {
  public *;
}
-keep class * implements org.eclipse.jface.wizard.IWizard {
  public *;
}
}}}

To exclude all access methods (getters and setters) there is another generic way:

{{{
-keep class * implements org.example.AnyInterface {
  void set*(***);
  void set*(int, ***);
  boolean is*();
  boolean is*(int);
  *** get*();
  *** get*(int);
}
}}}

_Remark: If you modified the proguard.cfg file manually, then these changes will be lost when re-generating the configuration!_

==Obfuscate your code==

It's time to use your obfuscator. As it is embedded into the built process Eclipse runs the obfuscator when exporting a plugin, a project or a complete product.

Export a plugin with _File &gt; Export ..._

<img alt="Export your plugin" src="images/export_plugin_preview.png" height="400" width="381">

The plugin will be obfuscated and exported.

If you <a href="http://obfuscate4e.org/run-the-obfuscator-in-verbose-mode">run the obfuscation in "verbose" mode</a>, then you can see ant processing the plugin and&nbsp; check the applied names mapping in the file _proguard.map_. This file is located in the folder _temp.folder/_ of the plugin. This file shows a list of processed files as well as the names of class, fields and methods after obfuscation.

<img alt="Watch the applied mapping of classes, fields and methods" src="images/proguard_map_preview.png">

==Solving problems==

If the _obfuscate4e_ plugin does not work as expected, then you have some possibilities at hand.

* If the obfuscation works manually at first run, but not at subsequent runs: Refresh the Eclipse workspace and check if there is a folder <tt>@dot</tt> or <tt>temp.folder</tt> in the plugin project. If they are, then remove it. Eclipse _PDE_ build doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t run the customBuildCallbacks if they exist.
* Check the obfuscation setting in the _proguard.cfg_ file in your plugin project. The syntax of this file is explained at the <a href="http://proguard.sourceforge.net/">Proguard website</a> (look at the Usage section).
* Run the obfuscation in verbose mode. Ant produces some output which might show the problem.
* Go to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/obfuscate4e/issues/list">bug tracker</a>, there might be solutions matching your problem.
* If you encountered a bug, then you might submit a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/obfuscate4e/issues/list">bug report</a>.

Please submit the following information:

* The version of your _Java_ and _Eclipse_ installations,
* The contents of _proguard.cfg_ and _temp.folder/proguard.map_, if available,
* The output of the _verbose_ mode Ant run (see next section for details),
* optionally the _MANIFEST.MF_ of the plugin (to ease the check of the proguard configuration).

===Inspect the obfuscated product===

It is quite easy to look how _obfuscate4e_ processed your product. You need a de-compiler and an exported Eclipse _RCP_ product. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll describe the procedure on a linux box.<br>
I use <a href="http://jode.sourceforge.net/">Jode</a>. This Project seems &acirc;&euro;&oelig;dead&acirc;&euro;, at least there were no new releases <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jode/files/">since 2004</a>. But it works well for this job.

Download the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jode/files/">latest jode distribution</a> and extract the file <code>jode*.jar</code>. Then open a shell an go to the folder where you exported the product to. Now execute the command shown below:

{{{
java -jar ~/Apps/jode-1.1.2-pre1.jar $(echo plugins/*  | tr " " ",")
}}}

The <code>$(echo plugins/* | tr " " ",")</code> selects all jars and folders inside the <code>plugins/</code> directory and compiles tthem into a comma separated list. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s how _jode_ expects the resources to be inspected.

A window pops up and you can traverse the class structure and look at the obfuscated build.

===Run the obfuscator in verbose mode===

It might happen that the obfuscation does not work as expected. In this case there may be some "strange" folders in your project and the generated plugin jar contains non-obfuscated classes.

But the build process runs in headless mode and no errors or warnings are printed out in the console view.

The easiest way to debug the obfuscation process is to create and execute a build.xml file for the plugin.

At first generate a build.xml file by clicking on _PDE Tools &gt; Create Ant Build File_ in the context menu of the project or the _META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_ file.<br>
Then run the build.xml file by clicking the _Run As &gt; Ant Build_ entry of the context menu of the _build.xml_ file.<br>
The output of the plugin build is shown in the console view. Warnings and error messages are highlighted.

<img alt="Run the build script" src="images/run-build_xml_preview.png" height="159" width="400">

The target _post.@dot_ contains the messages relevant to the obfuscation. In the above screenshot there is a error message:

{{{
[subant] Failure for target 'post.@dot' of:
      /prj/de.partmaster.mytest/customBuildCallbacks.xml
[subant] The following error occurred while executing this line:
[subant] /prj/de.partmaster.mytest/customBuildCallbacks.xml:119:
      Problem: failed to create task or type proguard
[subant] Cause: The name is undefined.
[subant] Action: Check the spelling.
[subant] Action: Check that any custom tasks/types have been declared.
[subant] Action: Check that any &lt;presetdef&gt;/&lt;macrodef&gt; 
        declarations have taken place.
}}}

In this case _Ant_ could not find the declaration of the _proguard_ task. This should not happen in practice - otherwise check your Eclipse installation in _Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Manage configuration_ for broken plugin dependencies.<br>As a rule of thumb you should follow make sure that you

# rebuild the _customBuildCallbacks.xml_ file if you change the package structure of the plugin,
# rebuild the _build.xml_ file if you change anything in _customBuildCallbacks.xml_.
# run the _build.xml_ script in verbose mode if you cant find the error.
# Attach the verbose console output together with the file proguard.properties to any <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=202507">bug report</a> and name the version of Java and Eclipse you are using.
