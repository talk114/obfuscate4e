Obfuscate4e integrates obfuscation into the Eclipse PDE build process. It enables obfuscation of your plugins, features and RCP applications during the regular build.

Obfuscate4e comes with the ProGuard obfuscator, but can easily be adapted for other obfuscators.

Youâ€™re welcome to join the development team, if you want to improve obfuscate4e or want to integrate additional obfuscators.

### Please note ###

On 2012-01-31 we restructured our online resources of the obfuscate4e project:

  * All documentation has moved here to the project wiki at code.google.com.
  * The blogposts got an own section in our company blog at http://www.partmaster.de/tags/obfuscate4e

The Updates site at http://obfuscate4e.org/updates/ stays intact and delivers all updates. The update site for beta releases at http://obfuscate4e.org/updates/dev/ is also working at it's established location.
This way we can concentrate on the issue queue and further development instead of managing a CMS. ;)
